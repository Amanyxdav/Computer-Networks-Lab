# Computer-Networks-Lab
This repository is for all the practical assignments of subject Computer Networks, Subject Code - AI-2051


### List of Lab Experiments to be performed :- 

1. Setup a network and configure IP addressing, subnetti Packet Tracer, Student Ed) 
2. Use basic networking commands in Linux (ping, tracc RARP, ip, ifconfig, dig, route ) 
3. Build a simple network topology and configure it for packet tracer. 
4. Perform network discovery using discovery tools (eg. 
5. Use Wireshark to understand the operation of TCP/IP 
   1. Ethernet Layer : Frame header, Frame size etc 
   2. Data Link Layer : MAC address, ARP (IP and 3. 
   3. Network Layer : IP Packet (header, fragments), ICMP (Query and Echo)
   4. Transport Layer: TCP Ports, TCP handshake segments etc. 
   5. Application Layer: DHCP, FTP, HTTP header formats 
6. CRC/ Hamming code implementation. 
7. Stop and wait protocol/ sliding window (selective repeat / Go back N ) 
8. Use simulator (Eg. NS2) to understand functioning of ALOHA, CSMA/CD
